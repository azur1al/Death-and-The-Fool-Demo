    <h2>( Relationship Troubles )</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p><i>From: <a href="./disconnection.html">Anonymous</a></i></p>
        <p><i>Hey, Sun. Thank you so much for providing this platform for people to be able to get advice and support when they need it. Though I usually am an active commenter on your site, today I'll be the one seeking some advice.</i></p>
        <p><i>Lately, my partner has been coming home each evening in worse and worse moods, and I'm not sure how to help. I've tried to make them feel better by listening to them as they talk about their day, cooking their favourite meals, watching their favourite movies together, and setting up days where we can relax and have some fun together.</i></p>
        <p><i>But, no matter what I seem to do, they always find something wrong with it - I'm not listening enough, or I didn't cook something right, or the movie isn't the right edition, or they just want to stay home because it's easier - except they manage to word it all like I'm the one with the problem.</i></p>
        <p><i>Recently, they've started getting increasingly aggressive, and I'm worried that they might get violent. I don't know what to do.</i></p>
        <p><i>Thank you in advance for your help.</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>Thank you so much for trusting the community with this, anon.</p>
      <p>I think that the best thing that you can do in this situation is talk it out with them. It seems like they're not communicating their needs adequately, and maybe you aren't asking the right questions.</p>
      <p>I think that as soon as you resolve the communication chasm that seems to be forming, all your other concerns should wash away.</p>
      <p>Try to organise a time together to sit down and discuss everything that is worrying you, and see where it goes! I wish you the best.</p>
      <p>- The Sun</p>

            <div class="comment-post">I definitely agree!!! Relationships require work in order to work! There's clearly some kind of miscommunication going on here, I definitely think that just a decent conversation could really clear this up!!!</div>
